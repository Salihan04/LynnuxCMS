LynnuxCMS
=========

For the backend system of LynnuxCMS, we used Parse (http://www.parse.com) to store data and also scheduling the email delivery as well.

DataInitialization folders contain the test data records for the system. It is in JSON format which can be easily import back to Parse.

We have two main user type, one is CallCenter and one is Operator. The functionality of each user type is implemented under the respective folders: callCenter and operator.
